# Octodex

GitHub has a great mascot called Octocat. Octocat even has its own gallery of variations, created by GitHub itself and fans, called Octodex.

You can use all the tools you have at your disposal to get the job done. Use your browser's Developer Tools to inspect their site to find the exact font sizes and padding amounts.

Objectives

Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
Implement, from scratch, a given design
Understand HTML/CSS Layout
Be able to place elements on a page where you want them.
Use flexbox and grid techniques layout pages.
Work with media queries to build a responsive page.

Requirements

You should strive to implement the overall structure as close as possible. Focus on the relative layout, not on pixel perfection. For instance, having the header on one line with part of the nav on the left and part of the nav on right is more important than matching the weight of the text in the header.

Explorer Mode

Use app-app with alpha and name your project Octodex
Feel free to start with this template HTML

Recreate the page as closely as you possibly can. Use the same fonts, sizes, and colors. Use your browser's developers tool to determine the colors and fonts.

Select some Octocats to use on your page (12 to 16 or so). Your layout should be flexible but doesn't need to perfectly responsive.

Don't bother downloading details of the Octocat, we've made a site that will give you all the data you need.

Use CSS media queries to resize the Octocat containers to look great as the screen changes size. Even though the site has a desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile display, for explorer mode only worry about desktop and mobile.

Deploy your site.

TIP Reminder to breakdown the layout into smaller chunks that are easier to style

Adventure Mode

Add a tablet display to accommodate a tablet screen size.

Add a laptop display to accommodate a tablet screen size.

For the responsiveness of your cats, if you used flexbox for explorer mode, now use grids, if you grids, now use flexbox.

Epic Mode

Go back to one past homework and make it responsive.
Use this API to make your website data-driven.

HINT: fetch, javascript and document.createElement. This is a big jump, but I think you can handle it.
